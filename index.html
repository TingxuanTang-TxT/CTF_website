                <p>Capture-the-Flag (CTF) competitions are increasingly becoming a testbed for evaluating AI capabilities at solving security tasks, due to their controlled environments and objective success metrics. Existing evaluations generally examine how successful AI is at solving individual CTF challenges, in isolation from the human CTF player. However, in practice, it is equally likely that human CTF players may interact with AI agents and use them in a collaborative manner to solve CTF challenges. This possibility exposes a key knowledge gap: we do not know (<strong>RQ1</strong>) how humans perceive AI assistance for CTFs, (<strong>RQ2</strong>) how they actually collaborate with AI during a CTF, and (<strong>RQ3</strong>) if this collaboration is effective, in comparison with the performance of fully autonomous agents on the same, previously unseen challenges. We address this gap with the first empirical study of AI assistance in a live, onsite CTF, uncovering insights regarding human perception of AI capabilities, human-AI interaction, and the general effectiveness of AI in solving CTF challenges. In a study with 44 participants (out of the total 95 that participated in the CTF), we qualitatively study (i) how participants' perception, trust, and expectations shift before versus after hands-on AI use, and (ii) how participants collaborate with an instrumented AI assistant. Moreover, we also (iii) benchmark four autonomous CTF agents on the same fresh challenge set to compare outcomes with human teams and analyze agent trajectories. We find that, as the competition progresses, teams increasingly hand the AI assistant more agency by delegating larger subtasks to it. Yet solve rates are often constrained not by what the underlying models can do, but by the human side of the loop: effective prompting and context specification become the primary bottleneck. Remarkably, autonomous agents that can self-direct their prompting and tool use bypass this bottleneck and outperform most human teams on the same challenges; the top-performing agent would place a close second on the human leaderboard. We conclude with implications for the future design of CTF competitions and for building effective human-in-the-loop AI systems for security.</p>

                    <p>To study human–AI collaboration in live CTF competitions, we design and deploy CTFriend, an agentic assistant tailored for CTF problem solving. CTFriend is not intended to function as an automatic CTF solver; instead, it provides a controlled and observable collaboration platform that supports CTF participants in using AI assistant during competitions, while enabling researchers to observe and analyze human–AI interaction behaviors systematically.</p>
